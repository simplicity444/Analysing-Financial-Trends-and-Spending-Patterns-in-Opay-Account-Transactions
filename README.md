## Data sources

This project analyses a comprehensive dataset derived from Opay account statements spanning from July 2023- July 2024. The dataset includes over 1,600 transactions categorized type such as transfers, airtime purchases, data and utility payments, date of transactions, transaction ID, credit and debit transactions.

### Tools Used
- Power BI 
   1. For Data Cleaning 
   2. For Data Analysis 
   3. For Data Visualization 

### Data Cleaning and Preparation

In the initial phase of data cleaning and preparations, I performed the following actions:

### Data Loading and Inspection: Loaded the Opay statement of account PDF file into Power BI by selecting Get Data and connecting to the PDF file. Selected all tables and initiated Transform Data to activate the Power Query Editor.

- Handling Account Details and Table Structure: Deleted the first three tables containing account owner details. Reviewed each table to ensure consistent column structure and data types.

Data Cleaning and Formatting:

Appending Tables: Combined all tables into a single comprehensive table.

Creating Debit and Credit Columns: Used conditional formulas to separate amounts into Debit and Credit columns:

Debit: = if [Amount] < 0 then [Amount] else null

Credit: = if [Amount] > 0 then [Amount] else null


Replaced null values in the new columns with 0.

Extracting Date Information: Extracted Month and Day of the Week from the transaction date to facilitate analysis.

Cleaning Description Column: Standardized transaction descriptions by categorizing them. Used a formula to classify descriptions into categories like "Transfer," "Mobile Data," "Electricity," etc., based on specific keywords.


Finalizing and Saving Data: Disabled all tables from loading except the appended table, applied changes, and saved the cleaned dataset.
